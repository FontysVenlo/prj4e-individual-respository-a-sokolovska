# Feedback archive
This document is intended for storing feedback received from professors, teammates, and other stakeholders. 

#### Mentioned stakeholders:
- Project coaches: Frank van Gennip, Lennart Tange
- Project teammates: Ben Gonzalez Zumbüelte, Louis Legére
- External stakeholders: Sander Bruinsma, Eric Peters

### Week 1-4
After long discussions  of project idea within the team, got an approval for initial project idea being amphibious robotic duck from the project coaches. Need for scoping and remarks were given on possible features of the project (eg. realtime video streaming, automated duck recognition).

### Week 5
Sum of the feedback from coaches: <br>
Reduce the scope of the project to only one enviroment for the robot, as two may be overcomplicated for the current level. For the propulsion system options, go for the initial idea of mounted Mississippi wheels. Also leave most of engineering for later, right now the focus should be the conceptual idea. <br>
Overall, the team is on schedule and has progress under control.

### Week 6
Tutoring hour: <br>
Opt for the prebuild products such as toy boats or duck decoys to evade building the frame for the robot from scratch. 
With the current scope, we should also consider additional motion sensor for detecting the direction of movement. The wheels won't be working perfectly in sync, so the direction may diviate from straight and needs to be corrected. Integrating compass may be a simple solution with this. Also we should keep in mind balancing and weight control. <br> 
Overall progress approved.

### Projects weeks 1 and 2
Despite being delayed by components delivery, we made maximun progress with what we already had on our hands. Didn't get much feedback besides the approval of progress. 


### Week 8-10
Progress slowed due to resuming lectures. Should not forget about software. Discussed the need for a separate power source for control logic and an ON/OFF switch for safe operation. Also got firm advice on not using nails for the wheel connection. Great comment on positioning of the motor inside the frame: horizontal motor mount would provide better weight distribution and easier mounting.

### Week 11
After discussions with mr Tange, decided to stick to a single power source both for motors and controller woth sensors. This introduces some minor questions about connection for voltage check to keep track of battery status, but should be doable
PDP needs documented progress for each goal, but the story form is not necessary.

A lot of advices from mr Peters, including suggestions on switching to flexible bendable wiring, proper soldering and isolation techniques, toggle switch attachment, etc.

### Week 12
Mr van Gennip directed back to two power sources. LiPo batteries have generalized graph for dropping capacity, so that can be used fro AD conversion. Also considering this project is a prototype, we have no need to worry about customer maintainance like user-friendly positioning of the batteries.

### Week 14
Correction from mr Peters on safety measures for the power circuiting - addition of fuses; As well as discussions with him in a reflective way on other options for the propulsion system for better waterproofness (propellers mounted in a U or L shape).
