### Week 1-4
After long discussions  of project idea within the team, got an approval for initial project idea being amphibious robotic duck from the project coaches. Need for scoping and remarks were given on possible features of the project (eg. realtime video streaming, automated duck recognition).

### Week 5
Sum of the feedback from coaches: <br>
Go for only one enviroment for the robot, as two may be overcomplicated for the current scope. Out of movement options, go for the initial idea with Mississippi wheels. Also leave most of engineering for later, right now the focus should be conceptual idea. <br>
Overall, the team is on schedule and has progress under control.
