# Feedback archive
This document is intended for storing feedback received from professors, teammates, and other stakeholders. 

#### Mentioned stakeholders:
- Project coaches: Frank van Gennip, Lennart Tange
- Project teammates: Ben Gonzalez Zumbüelte, Louis Legére

### Week 1-4
After long discussions  of project idea within the team, got an approval for initial project idea being amphibious robotic duck from the project coaches. Need for scoping and remarks were given on possible features of the project (eg. realtime video streaming, automated duck recognition).

### Week 5
Sum of the feedback from coaches: <br>
Go for only one enviroment for the robot, as two may be overcomplicated for the current scope. Out of movement options, go for the initial idea with Mississippi wheels. Also leave most of engineering for later, right now the focus should be conceptual idea. <br>
Overall, the team is on schedule and has progress under control.

### Week 6
Tutoring hour:
It's an option to take prebuild products such as toy boats or duck decoys to evade building the frame for robot from scratch. 
With the current idea, we should also consider additional motion sensor for detecting the direction of movement. The wheels won't be working perfectly in sync, so the direction may diviate from straight and needs to be corrected. Integrating compas may be a simple solution with this. Also we should keep in mind balancing and weight control. <br> 
Overall progress approved.

### Projects weeks 1 and 2
Despite being delayed by components delivery, we made maximun progress with what we already had on our hands. The outside stakeholders who were shown a small demo of our progress ramained rather intrested.

### Week 7


### Week 8-10
Progress slowed due to resuming lectures. Key focus was on figuring out the mechanical connection between motors and the paddle wheels. Initial electrical system was completed (all components connected), but interaction is not yet tested. Shouldnot forget about software. Discussed the need for a separate power source for control logic and an ON/OFF switch for safe operation. Also got firm advice on not using nails for the wheel connection.

### Week 11

### Week 12

### Week 13
 After discussions with mr Tange, decided to stick to a single power source both for motors and controller woth sensors. This introduces some minor questions about connection for voltage check to keep track of battery status, but should be doable. Aldo great advice on positioning of the motor inside the frame: horizontal motor mount would provide better weight distribution and easier mounting.
  PDP needs documented progress for each goal, but the story form is not necessary.

### Week 14
Mr van Gennip said go for two power sources, LiPo batteries have generalized graph for dropping capacity, it's a prototype so no need to worry about customer maintainance, 5V
