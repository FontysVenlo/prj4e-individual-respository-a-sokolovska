### Weeks 1-6
 Looking back at the past 6 weeks, I should divide reflection into two parts: in-project and outside of it. <br> <br>
 **Inside the project scope**, the main focus has been the research of hardware choice possibility. While it's not by any means small topic, it could have been done way more efficiently and less time-consuming had I organized the proper plan. For example, instead of starting from rather complex module being motor and constantly switching to other mentioned in articles/videos topics, I should have first figure out the complexity of hardware to be researched and start from the easiest component.
 But overall, the research went rather good and I now feel much more confident explaining and dicussing the choices I have made in motor, motor driver and microcontroller findings.  <br>
 Another part regarding project was teamwork. The phase of analysing and advising is quite unique, but at the given current point, our teamwork is mid. Considering we only have 3 people in the group, we could have divided the workload more practically. While we had very productive discussions alltogether, only 2 of us contributed to actual choice of the modules. At the same time, this has not been talked through in the team beforehand, so a note to improve for next time. <br> <br>
 **Outside the project**, I started out good with my personal goals, but now am falling behind. This is mainly explained by increasing workload of mandatory modules and additional outside factors. I should have done prioritazation differently, that way I could have been under less presure right now. Other than personal goals outside the module though, the progress has been rather steady and is now becoming more and more visible, as I'm more comfortable with talking about relevant topics (hardware disscusions in INES, OSCO)

### Weeks 7-11 
**Inside the project scope**, progress has been a bit slower due to the resumed lecture weeks, but still present. The main focus has been on the propulsion system attachment, particularly coming up with ideas on how to connect the water wheels to the motors. The 3D-printed parts are still in progress, which delays physical testing, but the research phase is rather ending - we figured out the main structure of the connection. Another important milestone was reaching the initial electrical circuit completion, even though the components are only physically connected and not yet interacting, this already gives us a starting point for further programming. Reaching these two milestones makes me feel good about our progress despite the slightly slowed momentum and if we continue this pace, the final model should be deliverable without major issues. <br><br>
Teamwork-wise, things have gotten better since the week 6, though of course there is still huge room for improvement. Now that we have entered the phase with actual hardware work, work distribution got more balanced and each of us now has clear tasks in specific areas. We have been neglecting proper documentation lately, including feedpulse and kanban board management, but made sure to stay on the same page within the team with stand-up meetings and involvement in each other tasks. For the upcoming weeks though, we should make sure to be more attentive towards documentation. The atmosphere within the team is rather comfortable, but personally I have had a few moments when I should have been less explosive and explain my point of view better. I should work on being more patient going forward.
Another point to mention about teamwork is focusing: at times we tend to waste time during the project hours, but it's worth mentioning it happens rather rarely. Either way, that’s something to improve, especially as next project weeks are approaching. <br><br>

**Outside the project**, I must admit that my individual deliverables have fallen behind. My PDP needs updating and I haven’t been logging feedback or progress as clearly as I should have. While my involvement in the group work like testing motors and taking the lead in creating the circuit diagram, has been consistent and on time, my personal documentation and progress efforts have been lacking. In the coming weeks, I want to balance this by focusing on individual goals, refactoring my PDP, and catching up with documentation. I’ve noticed that when I focus my attention too much between modules, I lose track of personal planning. Going forward, I’ll try to reconsider my priorities so both group and individual aspects, so I can progress equally.

### Weeks 12-14
**Within the project**, we’ve been focusing on wrapping things up. This phase marked the point where the progress we’d made so far finally became visible and encouraging in all parts we had started earlier. We completed the propulsion system attachment, which is arguably one of the most challenging parts of the project, finalized the electrical layout, implemented a few safety measures, refactored the module interaction and conducted full testing in a water environment. During these weeks, we also improved our documentation and, in my opinion, became much better at gathering and processing feedback from stakeholders.

On the other hand, despite completing everything within the allocated timeframe, there were still areas for improvement. For example, we made key changes to the circuit layout quite late in the process, which led to a rather rushed integration of fuses into the power system. The research and implementation of these changes into an already assembled setup took time I had originally planned for testing. Still, I’m proud of how quickly and efficiently we managed to resolve the issue. To avoid situations like this in the future, we should have allocated more time for unexpected adjustments. These kinds of changes are an unavoidable part of the learning curve, especially since we are still new to such technical aspects, and I should have realized the need for bigger time flexibility earlier.

Speaking of unexpected setbacks, I had an incident during one of the assemblies where I accidentally fried a motor by mixing up the power and ground wires. Although it was quite frustrating, I took full responsibility for the mistake and made sure to replace the motor as quickly as possible so it wouldn’t delay the group’s progress. The experience turned out to be valuable: from that point on, I became much more careful with wiring and also simplified the assembly process to reduce the chance of similar errors in the future.

The team dynamic has been fantastic. At this closing stage of the project, we’ve become completely comfortable with each other, which has had a great effect on our efficiency. Stand-up meetings no longer felt like a mandatory procedure but instead became a natural and productive part of our day. Our Kanban board became much more organized, and we’ve been receiving valuable feedback throughout way more often.

One thing we could have improved, however, is the distribution of tasks. In retrospect, our division of work, although effective in practice, turned out to be a disadvantage when it came to documenting individual evidence for PDP. While we often worked on tasks altogether or in pairs, there weren’t many deliverables that showed that collaboration. As a result, the division ended up looking more segmented: I was mainly focused on hardware work, Louis on software implementation, and Ben on 3D printing and frame preparation.

**Outside the project**, it’s been a mixed experience for me. Rereading reflection of the previous weeks, I now realize I shifted my priorities heavily toward the project, which caused my other modules to fall behind. I did manage to complete several of my [personal goals](/documents/personal-goals.md) such as acquiring a drone license, completing the CS50 course, reading professional literature, and updating my CV, but the balance shifted too far in the opposite direction compared to before. With better planning and more realistic time estimation, I could have avoided this.

On the positive side, I’m much more satisfied with my personal deliverables lately. I’ve started documenting more frequently and in more detail not just for the project, but also in my day-to-day life. This turned out to be extremely helpful whenever I needed to revisit previous decisions and I definitely plan to continue with this habit even after the project ends. <br>
Another thing that I have noticed inprovement in is my social interaction. While I am still not particularly enjoing it, I stopped avoiding interacting with people, especially external stakeholders, until the last minute.

## Overall reflection - Summary

Looking back at the entire project, it’s clear how much growth has happened both individually and within the team. From the early research and planning phase to the final integration and testing, this has taught me a lot about technical skills, team collaboration and personal responsibility.

One of the biggest takeaways for me was the importance of proper planning and documentation. In the early stages, I often underestimated how much structure and preparation are needed to avoid confusion later on. This showed especially during moments of unexpected changes where we had to quickly adapt. While those situations were stressful, they turned into valuable and probably the most effective learning experiences. I now understand how essential it is to plan for flexibility and anticipate delays, especially in hardware-heavy projects.

Having said that, I am now way more confident and efficient in researching needed topics. This project involved a lot of reasearch in different topics, but I am proud of how it turned out. There are some adjustments that I plan to make for the future researches, but this semester has laid an undeniably strong base for improvement in efficiency and quality of my reaserching skill. With that, it is safe to say I am satisfied with the learning curve we have gone through. 

On a personal level, I noticed a clear shift in priorities over time. At first, I managed to balance my individual learning goals with the project fairly well, but as the project grew more complex, I leaned heavily into team deliverables, at the expense of progress in other modules. That imbalance showed the need for better time management and more realistic self-assessment. Still, I’m proud of the personal goals I did complete and of how I’ve improved my consistency in documentation and reflection. It is something that’s already making a difference in how I approach both academic and personal work.

Teamwork also went through a positive upgrade. We started out a bit disorganized, but by the end we ended up as a team with strong trust and communication. Our collaboration became much smoother and the working environment more enjoyable. Other than that, our task division could have been more dynamic, especially for better tracking in individual reflections. It's something I’ll keep in mind for future group projects. Personally, I have also become a better teammate, having to work on improving my patience and understanding.

| Went well | Could use some improvement |
|:---------:|:--------------------------:|
| Teamwork and communication | Task distribution |
| Completed 'must-haves' | Late-stage changes |
| Improved documentation habits | Inconsistent documentation early on |
| Stakeholder feedback | Unused sensor and code for it |
| Learning curve | Better documentation of the evidence |
| Hardware wiring | imbalance between project and other modules |
| Soldering | More proactive approach at times |
| Overall software structure |
| Working prototype with integrated safety measures |

In summary, this project pushed me outside of my comfort zone both technically and organizationally. And while not everything went according to plan, I now feel much more prepared to take on similar projects with greater experience, adaptability and confidence.
