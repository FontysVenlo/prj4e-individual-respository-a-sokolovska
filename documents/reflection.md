# Reflection
This document holds my documented part of self reflection throughout the semester. 

### Weeks 1-6
 Looking back at the past 6 weeks, I should divide reflection into two parts: in-project and outside of it. <br> <br>
 **Inside the project scope**, the main focus has been the research of hardware choice possibility. While it's not by any means small topic, it could have been done way more efficiently and less time-consuming had I organized the proper plan. For example, instead of starting from rather complex module being motor and constantly switching to other mentioned in articles/videos topics, I should have first figure out the complexity of hardware to be researched and start from the easiest component.
 But overall, the research went rather good and I now feel much more confident explaining and dicussing the choices I have made in motor, motor driver and microcontroller findings.  <br>
 Another part regarding project was teamwork. The phase of analysing and advising is quite unique, but at the given current point, our teamwork is mid. Considering we only have 3 people in the group, we could have divided the workload more practically. While we had very productive discussions alltogether, only 2 of us contributed to actual choice of the modules. At the same time, this has not been talked through in the team beforehand, so a note to improve for next time. <br> <br>
 **Outside the project**,
