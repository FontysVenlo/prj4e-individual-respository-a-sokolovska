# Weight Calculations
For the initial testing of the outer frame floating ability, the approximate weight of components-to-be was needed. Thus, based on the available datasheets, the approximate weight was calculated.

## Components: 
1. Microcontroller LilyGo TTGO - 40g
2. Compass sensor CMPS2 - 10g
3. Distance Sensor - 6g
4. Speaker MP3 - 21g
5. Motor Servo - 40g
6. LiPo battery - 44g

## Final formula:
1x Microcontroller + 1x Compass + 1x Distance Sensor + 1x Speaker module + 2x Motors + 2x LiPo batteries =
40 + 10 + 6 + 21 + 2 * 40 + 2 * 44 = 245g.

For safety measures and possibly additional components, add approximately 1/4 of the calculated number:
245 + 62 = **307g.**
