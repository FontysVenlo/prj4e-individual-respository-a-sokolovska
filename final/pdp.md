# Personal Development Plan

- A Personal Development Plan (PDP) is a detailed plan on how you will reach the learning outcomes you have set.
- It serves as a planning tool for your professional development.
- It will be reviewed and updated regularly.
- It helps you track your learning and performance throughout a given period.

### Initial PDP
- Rephrase the learning goals (see LG1 and LG2 in module description) in your own words.
- Then create a plan outlining how y0u will achieve these goals and what artifacts you will use to demonstrate your understanding and progress

**LO1:** the student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way. </br>

In my own words: I want to develop amphious robot that resembeles duck, while focusing on two main activities: realise and advise. Advising on hardware-intefacing would provide a technical base for the design phase based on requirements and realization on software layer would ensure properly working software system with proper integrity, security and system performance.
