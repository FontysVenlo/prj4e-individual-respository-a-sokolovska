# Personal Development Plan


This document holds my personal development plan for documentation of my progress towards achieveing Learning Outcomes 1 and 2 (LO1 & LO2) of Project 4 module. LO1 and LO2 are separated into two categories for better readability and consistency.

- [Learning Outcome 1](#lo1)
- [Learning Outcome 2](#lo2)

----

### LO1:
 *The student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way.* </br>

In my own words: I want to develop amphious robot that resembeles duck, while focusing on two main activities: realise and advise. Advising on hardware-interfacing would provide a technical base for the design phase focused on requirements; realization on software layer would ensure properly working software system with proper integrity, security and system performance. The learning curve will involve hardware research (motor types, microcontrollers, power supply options, etc), hardware assembly, C/C++ skills enhancing (real-time system respose to outside factors, smooth and precise components control, etc)

**Plan:**
| Week | Task                  | Relevant artifacts |
|:----:|-----------------------|:-----------------|
|  1   | Project Introduction, familiarization with provided module information  | Project 4 module Canvas files, [Module Description](/documents/md_prj4_2025.pdf), etc |
|  2   | Brainstorming ideas, defining initial project requirements | [Ideas list](/images/brainstorm.jpeg)
|  3   | Refining project concept, finalizing initial specifications | [Initial project idea](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e02/blob/main/doc/initial-project-idea.md)
|  4   | Drafting Personal Development Plan (PDP) v1 | |
|  5   | Theoretical initial research on potential hardware, identifying key technical constraints| [Personal Notes on Components](/documents/notes.md) |
|  6   | Advising based on analysed requirements, first selected modules, parallel research of software architecture | [Hardware selection document](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e02/blob/main/doc/GreatComponentList.md) |
|  7   | Project charter finalization |[Project Charter](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/prj4e-repository-group_e02/blob/main/doc/Project4-charter-02.md)|  
|  PW1 | Basic hardware building, outer frame, basic software implementation ||
|  PW2 | Second project week, finalizing first rough prototype with movement, but not nessessorily on water yet | |
|  8   | Focus on more in-depth software implementation | |
--------

#### Success Indicators

- A structured project plan with agile methodologies.
- A clear technical documentation for hardware and software implementation.
- Documented progress with explained choices.
- Successfully implemented and tested both software and hardware.
- Constructive feedback from team members and coaches regarding both technical and professional skill development.

### LO2:
*The student demonstrates professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented organization, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted interaction.*

In my words: For learning outcome 2, I am aiming to enhance my soft skills and work towards being more perspective aware and informed on relevant options, also setting concrete and well-defined goals, and communicating more effectively by considering more detailed aspects for each important interaction.
