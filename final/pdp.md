# Personal Development Plan


This document holds my personal development plan for documentation of my progress towards achieveing Learning Outcomes 1 and 2 (LO1 & LO2) of Project 4 module. LO1 and LO2 are separated into two categories for better readability and consistency.

- [Learning Outcome 1](#lo1)
- [Learning Outcome 2](#lo2)

----

### LO1:
 *The student plans and executes a project in their track at level 2 of the HBO-i framework regarding autonomy and complexity, in an agile way.* </br>

In my own words: I want to develop amphious robot that resembeles duck, while focusing on two main activities: realise and advise. Advising on hardware-interfacing means analyzing, selecting, and justifying hardware components to meet functional and safety requirements. This would provide a technical base for the design phase focused on requirements; realization on software layer suggests designing and implementing  embedded software that controls hardware in a multithreaded, event-driven system. Well-done realization would ensure properly working software system with integrity, security and system performance. The learning curve will involve hardware research (motor types, microcontrollers, power supply options, sensors), hardware assembly, C/C++ skills enhancing (real-time system respose to outside factors, multithreading, smooth and precise components control, integrated safety features, etc).

--------

#### Success Indicators

- A structured project plan with agile methodologies.
- A clear technical documentation for hardware and software implementation.
- Documented progress with explained choices.
- Successfully implemented and tested both software and hardware.
- Constructive feedback from team members and coaches.

### LO2:
*The student demonstrates professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented organization, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted interaction.*

For Learning Outcome 2, I aim to strengthen my soft skills by developing better perspective awareness, setting clear and realistic goals, and improving how I communicate in various contexts. I want to become more intentional in how I plan, research, interact, and lead throughout this project, building a mindset thatâ€™s both technically informed and people-aware.
