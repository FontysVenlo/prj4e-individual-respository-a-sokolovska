# Personal Development Plan

- A Personal Development Plan (PDP) is a detailed plan on how you will reach the learning outcomes you have set.
- It serves as a planning tool for your professional development.
- It will be reviewed and updated regularly.
- It helps you track your learning and performance throughout a given period.

### Initial PDP
- Rephrase the learning goals (see LG1 and LG2 in module description) in your own words.
- Then create a plan outlining how you will achieve these goals and what artifacts you will use to demonstrate your understanding and progress
